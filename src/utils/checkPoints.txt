here we are going to add cloudinary service, basically for uploading we are using third party service and for such kind of operstions
in production the good practice is to have such files in utils folder.

for uploading there are multiple things which you can upload such as image, video, etc and all have same process.

after creating this structure we can inject this structure in any end point as a MIDDLEWARE. 


STEPS of setting:

1.we will use 'multer' for the uploading.
(cloudinary is not directly used, actually cloudinary is a service which gives us the functionality of uploading)

2. we will take file from multer and will store that file in our local server (temproarily)

3. from cloudinary we will take the file from the local server then to the main server. (this is done for redo the service if failed)
